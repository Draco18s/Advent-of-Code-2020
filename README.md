*Started late on day 1.*

*Day 10 took an embarrassingly long time to optimize.*

*Day 13 outputs a wolframalpha query. I feel dirty. :(*

*Day 18 I kept messing up the Shunting Yard algorithm.*

*Day 20 I was asleep for 7.5 hours. Had to rewrite edge-matching twice to finish part 2.*

*Day 21 I struggled. 7.5 hours of sleep.*

*Day 23 went to bed after part 1. Part 2 had multiple interruptions leading to stupid mistakes.*
